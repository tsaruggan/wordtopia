# Wordtopia

Wordtopia is an AI dictionary + thesaurus powered by OpenAI language models. By leveraging prompt engineering techniques and OpenAI's Batch API, we generated definitions and embeddings for over 300K words. Language is always evolving, with words changing in meaning over time due to collective memory, semantic context, and daily use. This fun experiment lets us to study the what AI may internally deduce words to mean, especially in relation to other words in its training corpus. Use our custom vector database to quickly search for words with cosine-similar embeddings (vibes).
